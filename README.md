# Adulting Web Application

# The Pitch:
Adulting is hard and not particularly fun.  Being a responsible well-rounded adult is even harder. What if there was an app for that?    

# Functionality:
This web app requires a user login, creates an account in the database and stores information including their current experience points and level. 

After logging in, the user will see their name, current level and experience displayed along with seven areas or "categories" to complete quests.  A quest is a task that is relevant to each zone and upon completetion, that task will be removed and the displayed experience points will be added to the user's total.  

The goal of this app is to encourage the user to complete quests and gain levels of Adulthood within the app by doing things outside of the app that are beneficial to human development.  The user should feel good about the quests they compete both within the app and see real world results. 

# Tools Used:
